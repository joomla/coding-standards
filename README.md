Joomla Coding Standards
=======================

This repository includes the [Joomla](http://developer.joomla.org) coding standard definition for [PHP Codesniffer](http://pear.php.net/PHP_CodeSniffer) along with a few other helpful resources.  The PHP_CodeSniffer standard will never be 100% accurate, but should be viewed as a strong set of guidelines while writing software for Joomla.
