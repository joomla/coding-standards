## Joomla Coding Standards Manual

Good coding standards are important in any development project, but particularly when multiple developers are working on the same project. Having coding standards helps ensure the code is of high quality, has fewer bugs, and is easily maintained.

First rule, if in doubt, ask. There is a tool available to help your code conform to the standards.
